Hey, my name is Aussie or CountTo8 and I am a young, first year Cyber Security student.

DNS Scanner is my first ever piece of code that I have uploaded to GitHub as a proper project, and my first ever upload. If you guys could give me feedback, I would take it into condsideration to improve any future projects I make.

The name DNS Scanner came from the whole purpose of the program which is to resolve the hostname and IP of a DNS and then use that information to scan ports. My inspiration to create this was because of my experience with Kali Linux and the apps inside that and I wanted to make one on my own to get an understanding of how they work, etc.

If you have any inquiries, you can add my Discord @ Aussie#7004

Any feedback would be appreciated
